        <h2>HTML Attributes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML elements can have attributes</li>
            <li>Attributes provide additional information about the element</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Example Explained</h2>
        <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The declaration defines this document to be HTML5</li>
            <li>The element is the root element of an HTML page</li>

    <div class="AboutCSS">
        <h2 id="CSS">What is CSS?</h2>
        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
            CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed</p>
        <p>The selector points to the HTML element to style (h1).
            The declaration block (in curly braces) contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
            Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
            In the following example all elements will be center-aligned, red and have a font size of 32 pixels:</p>
        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used to structure a
            web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media),
            CSS comes through and specifies your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS. Think of HTML as the foundation (every house has one), and CSS as the aesthetic choices (there’s a big difference between a Victorian mansion and a mid-century modern home).</p>
        <p>You might be wondering how this CSS code is actually applied to HTML content, though. Much like HTML, CSS is written in simple, plain text through a text editor or word processor on your computer, and there are three main ways to add that CSS code to your HTML pages. CSS code (or Style Sheets) can be external, internal, or inline. External style sheets are saved as .css files and can be used to determine the appearance of an entire website through one file (rather than adding individual instances of CSS code to every HTML element you want to adjust). In order to use an external style sheet, your .html files need to include a header section that links to the external style sheet and looks something like this:</p>

    <div class="AboutJS">
        <h2 id="JS">What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
            The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML
            and run automatically as the page loads. Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t
            need special preparation or compilation to run.
            In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.</p>
        <p>Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device
            that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.
            The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.
            Different engines have different “codenames”.</p>
